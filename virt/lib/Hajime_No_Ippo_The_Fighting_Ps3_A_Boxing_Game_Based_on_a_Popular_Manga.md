One of the main attractions of Hajime No Ippo The Fighting Ps3 is the variety of characters and fighting styles that you can choose from. Each character has their own strengths and weaknesses, as well as their own signature moves that can turn the tide of the battle. For example, Ippo's trademark move is the Dempsey Roll, a powerful combination of hooks that can knock out his opponent in one hit. However, he also has to deal with his stamina and durability, as he tends to take a lot of damage in his fights.
 
Another example is Takamura Mamoru, Ippo's mentor and the current world champion in two weight classes. He is a strong and aggressive fighter who can overwhelm his opponents with his speed and power. However, he also has a tendency to lose his temper and get careless, which can expose him to counterattacks. He also has to deal with his weight management, as he often struggles to make the weight limit for his fights.
 
Other characters include Miyata Ichiro, Ippo's rival and a skilled counter-puncher; Mashiba Ryo, a ruthless fighter who uses his long reach and flicker jabs; Sendo Takeshi, a wild and ferocious brawler who loves to fight; Aoki Masaru, Ippo's friend and a comic relief character who uses unconventional moves; and many more. Each character has their own backstory and personality that adds to the depth and realism of the game.
