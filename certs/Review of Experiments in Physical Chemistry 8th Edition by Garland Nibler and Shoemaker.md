# Review of Experiments in Physical Chemistry 8th Edition by Garland, Nibler and Shoemaker
 
Experiments in Physical Chemistry is a comprehensive laboratory textbook that includes experiments with background theoretical information, safety recommendations, and computer applications. The book covers various topics in physical chemistry such as gases, thermochemistry, solutions, phase behavior, electrochemistry, chemical kinetics, surface phenomena, macromolecules, electric, magnetic, and optical properties, spectroscopy, solids, electronic devices and measurements, temperature, vacuum techniques, instruments, and miscellaneous procedures. The book also provides instructions on how to use spreadsheets and other scientific software as well as how to interface experiments with computers using Visual Basic and LabVIEW.

The 8th edition of the book was published in 2009 by McGraw-Hill Science/Engineering/Math and has 734 pages. The authors are Carl W. Garland, Joseph W. Nibler, and David P. Shoemaker, who are all professors of chemistry at Oregon State University. The book is intended for undergraduate students who are taking physical chemistry courses and need to perform laboratory experiments as part of their curriculum. The book is also suitable for graduate students and researchers who want to refresh their knowledge of physical chemistry experiments or learn new techniques.
 
The book has several features that make it a useful and reliable resource for physical chemistry experiments. First, the book provides clear and detailed explanations of the theoretical principles behind each experiment as well as the experimental procedures and data analysis methods. Second, the book offers safety tips and precautions for handling chemicals and equipment as well as troubleshooting advice for common problems that may arise during the experiments. Third, the book includes numerous examples of data tables, graphs, calculations, and reports that illustrate how to present and interpret experimental results using computer software. Fourth, the book contains references to relevant literature sources and websites that provide additional information or resources for each experiment.
 
The book has received positive reviews from students and instructors who have used it for their physical chemistry courses. Some of the strengths of the book are its clarity, comprehensiveness, accuracy, relevance, and flexibility. Some of the weaknesses of the book are its high price, outdated software versions, and occasional errors or typos. Overall, the book is a valuable and effective tool for learning and teaching physical chemistry experiments.

Another aspect of physical chemistry experiments is the use of online simulations and virtual labs that allow students and teachers to explore various phenomena and concepts without the need for physical equipment or materials. Online simulations and virtual labs can provide interactive, engaging, and accessible learning experiences that complement or supplement traditional laboratory activities. Online simulations and virtual labs can also help students develop inquiry skills, conceptual understanding, and scientific reasoning.
 
There are many online resources that offer free or low-cost simulations and virtual labs for physical chemistry topics. Some examples are:
 
- **PhET Interactive Simulations**: PhET, based at the University of Colorado Boulder, offers over four dozen chemistry-based simulations, many translated into different languages. Search by subject and grade level[^1^].
- **Virtual Chemistry and Simulations**: This page from the American Chemical Society (ACS) collects descriptions and links to a huge number of chemistry simulations, with peer review ratings and comments, and information on appropriate grade levels[^2^].
- **ChemCollective**: The ChemCollective, organized by a group from Carnegie Mellon, shares virtual labs, simulations, and molecular level visualizations for chemistry. Users can also create their own scenarios or modify existing ones[^3^].
- **goREACT**: This drag-and-drop periodic table environment from Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry lets users experiment with different element combinations and see the results of chemical reactions.
- **Molecular Workbench**: Molecular Workbench provides visual, interactive computational experiments for teaching and learning science. Users can browse or create their own simulations using a powerful authoring system.

Online simulations and virtual labs can enhance the learning of physical chemistry by providing students with opportunities to explore, experiment, and discover in a safe, convenient, and fun way.
